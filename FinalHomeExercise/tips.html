      <h2>“Fully vaccinated” doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19”</h2>
      <p>As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully vaccinated might be feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn’t the time to let your guard down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that you could become infected.</p>
      <p>Dr. Cardona explains.</p>

      <p>“‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.”</p>

      <h2>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others, including other vaccinated people?</h2>
      <p>While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines.</p>

      <p>“The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations.”</p>
